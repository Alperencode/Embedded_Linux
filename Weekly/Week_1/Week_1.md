# Week 1

## Week 1 Plan

- <u>[Setup Stage](#setup-stage)</u> 
- Setting-up Raspberry Pi ✔️
- Setting-up SSH connections ✔️
- **Extra**: Port forwarding for SSH connection ✔️
- Hardware integrations
<br>
- <u>[Research Stage](#research-stage)</u>
- Researching keywords
- Researching hardware and utilities
- Researching implementations

> [!NOTE]
> In my Gantt Chart I was going to start the `Setup Stage` in Week 2 but because I've already know how to setup raspberry and SSH connections, I just did it in `Research Stage` to reduce workload for Week 2.

## Setup Stage

Notes:

- I used **32-bit Raspberry pi for the OS** on my raspberry.
- I've added **custom host-name** to my computer hosts file so I don't have to remember IP address for next time.
- I've set **SSH port forwarding to my router** so I can use SSH connection over the Internet.

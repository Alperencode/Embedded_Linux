## Gantt Chart

I've learned that A Gantt chart is a visual timeline that shows tasks and their timelines in a project. It helps with planning and tracking progress.

I've also noticed during my researches that you can create Gantt Chart structure using Github Projects section. I didn't have time to try this by myself 

I've watched the following videos and researched on the internet to get more details about Gantt Charts:

## End of the Week

This week I had another school project deadline so I couldn't spend the exact time I planned for this week. But in the next week I'll start the `Research Stage` and I'll begin to obtain more detailed information about the project.
